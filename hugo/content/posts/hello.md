Welcome to the landing page for Dr Medaka's School for Fish and Kanji Learners.  

Homework: Please download the PDF and print it.
Instructions: (1) Print 5 pages containing 5 AR markers:[Download ARMarkers for Season 1](pdf/drmedakas_school_armarkers_s1.pdf) (2) Place AR markers in good lighting, around your home, mansion, or apartment.  (3) turn on the lights (4) launch the lens via snapcode: https://www.spectacles.com/lens/50143adace934c339d13ba8419e51cdc?type=SNAPCODE&metadata=01

NOTE: there are supposed to be 10 Kanji, however, asset size limits prevented delivery of 10 Kanji.  I'll update the Lens if I can get smaller assets in.

The Kanji for the numbers 1-10 are the learning module for Season 1 of the Lens.  Feel free to study these Kanji using various online resources: https://www.marimosou.com/how-to-write-kanji-numbers-110/

The number Zero has a complex Kanji.  It is better to consider the number use rather than Kanji, as you will see it more often in Japanese writing: 零 or 〇 ... or just use 0.
