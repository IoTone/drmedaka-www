Welcome to the landing page for Dr Medaka's School for Fish and Kanji Learners.  

Homework: Please download the PDF and print it.
Instructions: (1) Print 5 pages containing 5 AR markers.  (2) Place AR markers in good lighting, around your home, mansion, or apartment.  (3) turn on the lights (4) launch the lens via snapcode: https://www.spectacles.com/lens/50143adace934c339d13ba8419e51cdc?type=SNAPCODE&metadata=01

NOTE: there are supposed to be 10 Kanji, however, asset size limits prevented delivery of 10 Kanji.  I'll update the Lens if I can get smaller assets in.
